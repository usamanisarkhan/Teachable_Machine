# 🤖 My Personal AI Object Detector

## 🌟 Project Overview

I used **Teachable Machine** to train a custom image classification model. The goal of this project was to teach a computer to distinguish between me and common desk objects like pens and bottles.

### 🚀 Try It Live!

You can test this model yourself using your own webcam. No setup required:

## 📸 Proof of Concept

Here is a screenshot of the AI identifying me with high confidence:

## 🧠 How it Works

I trained the AI using four distinct classes:

1. **Usama:** Recognizes my face/presence in the frame.
2. **Bottle:** Identifies when a water bottle is held up.
3. **Pen:** Identifies when a pen is shown to the camera.
4. **Nothing:** A "background" class for when no objects are present.


## 🛠️ Tools Used

* **[Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/)** - Used for gathering data and training the neural network.
* **GitHub** - Used to host this documentation and share the project with the world.


## 📝 Reflection

Supervised Learning 
This project uses Supervised Learning because I provided "labeled data" (the names for each category) to the model. The AI learned by associating the visual patterns from the webcam with the specific labels I created
This project helped me understand how machine learning models use "classes" to organize information. It shows how easily we can teach a computer to recognize specific individuals versus inanimate objects.

**Would you like me to show you how to host this as a live "Web Page" using GitHub Pages so it looks like a real app?**
